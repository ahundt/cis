First Steps
===========

The following steps will show you how to

- download and install CIS on your system.
- use the installation to create an example.
- build and test the example project.

You need to have a Unix-like operating system such as Linux or Mac OS X installed on your
machine in order to follow these steps. At the moment, there is no separate tutorial
available for Windows users, but you can install CygWin as an alternative.
Note, however, that CIS can also be installed and used on Windows.


Install CIS
-----------------

Get a copy of the source code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`__ repository from `GitHub <https://github.com/schuhschuh/cis/>`__ as follows:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    mkdir -p ~/local/src
    cd ~/local/src
    git clone https://github.com/schuhschuh/cis.git
    cd cis
    
or :doc:`download` a pre-packaged ``.tar.gz`` of the latest release and unpack it using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p ~/local/src
    cd ~/local/src
    tar xzf /path/to/downloaded/cis-$version.tar.gz
    cd cis-$version


Configure the build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure the build system using CMake 2.8.4 or a more recent version:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    mkdir build && cd build
    ccmake ..

- Press ``c`` to configure the project.
- Change ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` to ``~/local``.
- Set option ``BUILD_EXAMPLE`` to ``ON``.
- Make sure that option ``BUILD_PROJECT_TOOL`` is enabled.
- Press ``g`` to generate the Makefiles.

Build and install CIS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CMake has generated Makefiles for GNU Make. The build is thus triggered by the make command:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    make

To install BASIS after the successful build, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    make install

As a result, CMake copies the built files into the installation tree as specified by the
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` variable.

.. _GettingStartedEnvironment:

Set up the environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the following tutorial steps, set up your environment as follows. In general, however,
only the change of the ``PATH`` environment variable is recommended. The other environment
variables are only needed for the tutorial sessions.

Using the C or TC shell (csh/tcsh):

.. code-block:: bash
    
    setenv PATH "~/local/bin:${PATH}"
    setenv CIS_EXAMPLE_DIR "~/local/share/cis/example"

Using the Bourne Again SHell (bash):

.. code-block:: bash
    
    export PATH="~/local/bin:${PATH} "
    export CIS_EXAMPLE_DIR="~/local/share/basis/example"


Create an Example
-----------------

Create an example using CIS:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    voluptate --velit esse --cillum dolore --eu



Test the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, 
sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim 
id est laborum.


.. code-block:: bash
    
    ipsum --in molestie

its use including in-depth information and references to further documentation. For a less
comprehensive tutorial-like introduction, please refer to the :ref:`FirstSteps` above.
